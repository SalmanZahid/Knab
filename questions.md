# Knab Technical Questions

##### 1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding assignment then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add

I spent 40 minutes on the coding assignment. I believe if i would do additional work for 20 mins i will love to add comparison between the currency rates of different provided crypto codes and user can get the idea which crypto currency is more powerful. I would also like to add a feature that user can provide amount of crypto currency they have and then calculate total worth of it in different currencies.

##### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your language of choice? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I have used the regular features that we use every day as provided by the language. Yes, a lamba expression is something have used and was previously introduced in C# 7.0:

`public RatesController(IExchangeRateService rateService) => exchangeRateService = rateService;`

##### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

The key to tracking down performance problems is to have sufficient logging to figure out what was going wrong when they were slow. 
Yes I have faced such situations and 90% it has been database which was causing performance issues. So apply logs at certain levels helps you identifying the root cause of problems in a system.

##### 4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn?

The most recent technical book that i have read was for my MCSA exam which was Exam Ref 70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Applications (MCSD)
Book by William Penberthy.
